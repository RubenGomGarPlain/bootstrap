# Skill Maintenance Guide

How to update, extend, and test the Plain Concepts skill suite.

## Adding a New Token

1. **Update `token-reference.md` first** — add the new token to the master table with its description, example, and which skills use it.
2. **Update all stub files** — find every file in every affected skill's `templates/` folder that should use the new token; replace the hardcoded value with the `__NEW_TOKEN__` placeholder.
3. **Update SKILL.md instructions** for each affected skill — add a step where the agent asks the user for the token value (if it requires user input).
4. **Test** — invoke the skill in a clean directory; verify the token is replaced in all output files and no `__NEW_TOKEN__` pattern remains.

## Updating Package Versions

1. **Update `Directory.Packages.props` stub** in `plain-dotnet-shell/templates/` — this is the single source of truth for all package versions.
2. **Do not update individual `.csproj` stubs** — all stubs use `<PackageReference Include="PackageName" />` without a version; the version comes from `Directory.Packages.props` centrally.
3. **Verify** by invoking `plain-dotnet-shell` in a clean directory and running `dotnet build` — confirm no version conflicts.

## Adding a New Reference Document to plain-dotnet-guardrails

1. **Create the `.md` file** in `plain-dotnet-guardrails/references/`.
2. **Add a link to it in `plain-dotnet-guardrails/SKILL.md`** — add a row to the Reference Documents table.
3. **Reference it from any skill SKILL.md that needs it** — add `Read [doc-name](./references/doc-name.md) from @skill:plain-dotnet-guardrails` at the relevant step.
4. **No re-publishing needed** — Copilot reads the current file on each invocation.

## Updating SKILL.md Instructions

1. Edit the `SKILL.md` directly — the file is the live instruction set.
2. No versioning or publishing step required — Copilot reads the current file on each invocation.
3. If you add new required inputs (token values), update `token-reference.md` to document the new token.
4. If you change the scaffold structure, update `arch-rules.md` or `modular-monolith-guide.md` to reflect the change.

## Testing a Skill

**Manual test procedure:**

1. Create a fresh empty directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/skill-test && cd ~/skill-test
   ```

2. Invoke the skill in Copilot.

3. After scaffolding, verify:
   ```bash
   dotnet build {ProjectName}.slnx         # Must exit 0 — no errors
   dotnet test {ProjectName}.slnx          # Must exit 0 — all tests pass
   ```

4. Inspect created file structure against the canonical structure documented in `modular-monolith-guide.md`.

5. Check for leftover tokens:
   ```bash
   grep -r "__[A-Z_]*__" src/ tests/
   ```
   This must return no results.

## Adding a New Skill

To add a new skill to the suite:

1. Create the skill folder: `.github/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`.
2. Add the trigger phrase "Read @skill:plain-dotnet-guardrails before executing." at the top of the new SKILL.md.
3. Add the new skill to the `skill-invocation-order.md` reference table.
4. Update `copilot-instructions.md` to include the new skill name and trigger phrases.
5. If the skill introduces new tokens, follow the "Adding a New Token" procedure above.

## Syncing to projects-awesome-copilot

Skills are authored in `plain.template.withai/.github/skills/` and synced to `projects-awesome-copilot/.github/skills/` for publishing. Sync procedure (manual for now):

1. Copy the updated skill folder(s) to `projects-awesome-copilot/.github/skills/`.
2. Update the `plugin.json` in `projects-awesome-copilot` if a new skill was added.
3. Open a PR in `projects-awesome-copilot` for review before publishing.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|
| Skill not activating in Copilot | Check `description` field — must be ≤ 1024 characters and contain the exact trigger phrase |
| Token not substituted | Verify the token is in `token-reference.md` and in the stub file content/name |
| `dotnet build` fails after scaffolding | Run skill again in a clean directory; if it fails consistently, check for missing project references in `.csproj` stubs |
| Module not discovered at startup | Verify `{ProjectName}.Server.csproj` has a `<ProjectReference>` to the module project |
| EF migrations fail | Verify `DesignTimeDbContextFactory` uses a valid local connection string |
